After doing that, it’s going to attach the events at the top level as even delegation… so you have event delegation by default.</p>\\n<h3>What’s JSX?</h3>\\n<p>JSX is an xml-like syntax to write html markup in your React component..which is familiar for all front end developers and adventurers. <br>\\nJSX doesn’t care about your component; the only job JSX has is to compile your markup code into native Javascript and will accept custom attributes when using <strong>data-</strong>. You also need to write attributes in javascript notation <strong>className</strong> instead of class, <strong>onClick</strong> and so on. <br>\\nYou will need curly braces <strong>{}</strong> to interpret your javascript inside JSX.</p>\\n<h3>React’s lifecycle</h3>\\n<p><br> <strong>Mounting/Unmounting</strong>\\n<br>\\nThe methods below are part of the mounting cycle…</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>getInitialState() // called before component is mounted, stateful components should implement this with initial state.</li>\\n<li>getDefaultProps() // called when the component is mounted, set default props to your component before any instance is intialized</li>\\n<li>componentWillMount() // called before mounting occurs</li>\\n<li>render()</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Those methods occurs every time before you see your App in the browser.</p>\\n<p>And these are part of Unmounting cycle…</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>componentDidMount() // at this point React has a representation of your component</li>\\n<li>componentWillUnmount() // At this point the component has been added to the document</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\\n<p>The methods part of the updating lifecycle are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) // called when a component is receiving new props, you can setState here and render won’t be called</li>\\n<li>shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) // return false when you know the component wont receive any update, called before render method</li>\\n<li>componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) // called before update occurs</li>\\n<li>render()</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>and after DOM mutations</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>componentDidUpdate(); // called after updates occurs</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Props vs State</h3>\\n<p>Parent components pass data through props to their children and the children can’t change the data received from the parents. <br>\\nYou can think of props as options, configuration (immutable).\\nStates are mutable where when used in your component you need a default state.
