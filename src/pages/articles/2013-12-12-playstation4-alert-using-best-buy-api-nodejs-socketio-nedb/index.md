Long story short.. I didn't want to check Best Buy every day to see if PS4 is available..
So I built this Web Application <a href="http://ps4alerts.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" title="Be notified when PlayStation 4 is available at Bes Buy">PS4 Alerts!</a> to check every one (1) minute Best Buy Data and if find any PS4 available in store or online will send me an email notification with a direct link to the product.

I also added one feature as subscription so more people can be notified as well.

### Specs

- Node.js/Express.js (Backend/Server)
- Socket.io (Real time communication with the client)
- Handlebars.js (as backend template view)
- NeDB (Database)
- <a href="https://bbyopen.com/" target="_blank" title="Best Buy open API">BBYOpen API</a>

Be advised I built it in two nights..Enjoy!
