My love for Javascript just get bigger and also my knowledge but that's not what I'm going to blog about today.. at this time I'm going to post about the Micro-Library I created Jet.js

## Jet.js

One of the senior developers at my former company was having some performance issues on a particular Web Application..
After see the code at my perspective one of the problems were all the plugins (was more than 15) being download on the entire Application.

I decided create a very lightweight library (called modular-script-loader) to solve that problem downloading scripts asynchronously (non-block) and on demand (not for all the pages).

So last night I decided re-write entirely using better Design pattern and cleaner code I also gave a better name "Jet.js".

### Code

Check out on Github <a href="http://www.github.com/weblancaster/jet" target=""_blank title="Jet js">Jet.js</a>

My goal here is to make the Web Application faster therefore <strong> download scripts asynchronously (non-block), better organized script dependency and very very lightweight</strong>.

Below is the code to make the "magic" happen..just a few lines of code.

### how to use

Define what are the widgets you want to use on that page (on body element).

<pre><code data-language="html">
< body data-ui-widget="widget-jquery widget-cycle" >
</code></pre>

include Jet.js on your page

<pre><code data-language="html">
<script src="js/jet.min.js"></script>
</code></pre>

I would suggest you create a JS file which has all your widgets been called.

<pre><code data-language="javascript">
// Cycle
var dependency1 = new Jet.App;
    dependency1.init('widget-cycle', 'http://malsup.github.io/jquery.cycle.all.js', function() {
        console.log('cycle loaded');
        $('#outdoor-context-content').cycle({
            fx: 'fade'
        });
    });
</code></pre>

Done!
