I haven't posted anything a while which is a shame but I had good reasons and I should be doing a post about it on my next post but this post is made to show what inspire me love this world what makes me think how wonderful things are and how much we can learn from our world.

## Love and Life

Love. Perhaps just a word for some but at the same time very powerful. Love drives us to different things in life. Good things and bad things. Both..So many perspectives from different cultures and races but same origin. Your inside.

Love inspire me in some many different ways and I'm not ashamed to say I believe in true love.
And here it's very interesting to see some ways people want to express love.

You decide which one suits you.
