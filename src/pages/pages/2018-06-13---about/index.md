My name is Michael Lancaster. 27. Born in Brasil but moved to US (I have dual citizenship USA and Brazilian) when I was 21 to follow my goals. Now living in San Francisco - CA.

I'm a Software Engineer focused in Javascript applications (Web, Mobile, Desktop) and often full-stack when including Node (I also get my hands dirty in Python). 
Currently working as Software Engineer - Frontend at [Mesosphere](https://mesosphere.com/)

My spare time I built and maintain side projects [Soundnode](http://www.soundnodeapp.com/), [Solshal](http://www.solshal.com/) and I try to contribute to open source projects here and there on [Github](http://www.github.com/weblancaster).
