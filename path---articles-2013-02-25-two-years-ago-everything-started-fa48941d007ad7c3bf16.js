Don’t have time? make time experiments are very important to expand your view outside of the “work box</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and this work is what keep me awake at night learning new things when everybody else is sleeping.</p>",fields:{date:"2013-02-25"},frontmatter:{title:"Two years ago everything started.",description:"This is a little history about my journey when two years ago I passed a test and got my first paid job as a Front End Developer Jr."}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/2013-02-25-two-years-ago-everything-started/"}}}});
