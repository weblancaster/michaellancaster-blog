# Michael Lancaster (new) blog

This is an upgrade of my personal blog from Jekyll to Gatsby. The theme used is [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) with some changes in the Gatsby-node build so I can include the missing formatting expected but not required before in Jekyll.
